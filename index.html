        <p>
            According to all known laws
of aviation, <br>

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly. <br>

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground. <br>

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway <br>

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible. <br>

        </p>

        <p>
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. <br>

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little. <br>

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready! <br>

  
Ooming! <br>

  
Hang on a second. <br>
        </p>
